At time of release there was a bug in perl (NETaa14423) which stopped the
use of this module being as intended

ie

 use FindBin qw($Bin $RealBin);
 use lib "$Bin/../lib","$RealBin/../lib";

a BEGIN can be used as a workaround

 use FindBin qw($Bin $RealBin);
 BEGIN { @LIBS = ("$Bin/../lib","$RealBin/../lib") }
 use lib @LIBS;

or

 use FindBin qw($Bin $RealBin);
 BEGIN { unshift(@INC, "$Bin/../lib","$RealBin/../lib") }
